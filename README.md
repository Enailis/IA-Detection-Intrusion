# IA-Detection-Intrusion

The following projects has been realized during the course "AI and intrusion detection" at the ENSIBS.

## Requirements

Everything you need to run these projects will be detailed in each sub-project.

If you ever need to run this project you will need the `.xml` files that are not included in this repository. You can contact me if you need them.

## Sub-project 1

The goal of this project is to retrieve data from XML files, send them to ELK and then be able to process them.

More information on how to install and run the project in the [README](./sub-project-1/README.md) of the sub-project 1.

### Disclaimer

The first sub-project uses an instance of ELK that is no longer runing on our personnal servers. If you want to run the project, you will have to install ELK on your own.

## Sub-project 2

The goal of this project is to use the dataset we extracted in the sub-project 1 and to create a machine learning model to detect intrusion.

More information on how to install and run the project in the [README](./sub-project-2/README.md) of the sub-project 2.
